Round-Robin Scheduling Algorithm 
    - similar to FCFS (first come first serve)
    - preemption is added to enable the system to switch 
      between processes. 
    - time quantum is defined (10 - 100 milliseconds)
    - ready queue is treated as a circular queue 
    - The CPU scheduler goes around the ready queue, allocating 
      the CPU to each process for a time interval of up to 1 time quantum 

Implementing Round-Robin Scheduling Algorithm (RR)
    - keep ready queue as a FIFO 
    - new processes are added to the tail of the ready queue 
    - CPU scheduler picks the first process from the ready queue 
      set a timer to interrupt after 1 time quantum
    - dispatch the process  

* Typically, higher average turnaround than SJF, but better response. 
* performacne (q = quantum)
    if q is large, it is same as FCFS 
    if q is small, q must be large with respect to context switch, otherwise
       over head is too high. 
    Trade-off: Throughpu (large q) v. response Time 

Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling 
- Multilevel queue scheduling algorithm is inflexible 
- However, Multilevel feedback queue scheduling algorithm allows a process to move
  between queues. (separate processes according to the characteristics of their CPU 
  burst). 
- leaves I/O-bound and interactive processes in the higher-priority queues. 
- process that waits too long in a lower priority queue may be moved to a
  higher-priority queue (aging)
- 

Process Control Blocks (PCB)
Foreground - interactive processes 
Background - batch (or system) processes 
TAT - Turnaround Time

Type: 
- FCFS
- SJF
- RR 


preemptive - OS interrupt running thread to schedule new thread 
           - can't just interrupt but waits till get to some place
             to stop 
non-preemptive - OS waits until the running thread blocks or
                  unilaterally surrenders CPU 

Scheduling Criteria 
- CPU utilization: 40-90%, keep the CPU as busy as possible  
- Throughput: Number of processes completed per unit of time 
- Turnaround Time (TAT): Time of process submission to time 
                         of completion
- Waiting Time: Total amount of time wating in ready queue   
- Response Time: Time a process takes from submission to 
                  start of response
